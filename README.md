# Chatbot-Playing-Music-from-live-face-expression

First I have collected data on 4 face expression categories- HAPPY,SAD,ANGRY,SURPRISING.
Then I have trained a machine learning model with the above colled data using neural networks .

Secondly I have stored songs on a database with 4 different above mentioned categories of different singers .

Then I have made a Chatbot using rasa framework .Built a chatbot trained it on different entries and appropriate response. I have also used computer vision to read live face expression from web cam.

Finally combined all the three jobs and made this project. 
These projects are deployed on my local server and telegram.
